Keyboard Shortcuts
==================

Keyboard controls are listed by issuing the command: ``tizonia --help
keyboard``. Tizonia is very minimalistic and offers just a few controls. There
is no fast-foward of rewind options. These may be added in the future.

EXAMPLES
--------

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tizonia --help keyboard
