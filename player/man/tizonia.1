Tizonia provides an efficient and unbstrusive music search and listening
experience by following a few principles:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fBSimplest CLI UI\fP
Because the keyboard is faster than the mouse you get to listen to the music
that you want in less time. Music plays almost immediately.
.TP
\fBPlay the music, not matter what\fP
Tizonia uses fuzzy string matching techniques to match your search keywords
against the data provided by the streaming services. This maximizes the
chances of finding the music that you want. When a search returns no
results Tizonia may at times try a \(aqI\(aqm Feeling Lucky\(aq guess.
.TP
\fBNon\-stop music\fP
Tizonia\(aqs play queue always runs in \fBlooped\fP mode. There is currently no
way to configure non\-looped playback (although this may be added in the
future, see [1]).
.TP
\fBLimit the distractions\fP
By limiting the interactions. No fast\-forward or rewind. Only skip to
next/previous track (see [2]). There is no elaborate \(aqncurses\(aq CLI
interface to interact with. But there is some track info and a simple visual
progress bar.
.TP
\fBReduced \(aqmuscle\-memory\(aq\fP
Finding the music that you want and listening to it should require a single
command\-line option on the terminal. E.g.: \fBtizonia \-\-spotify\-album Islands\fP\&.
Bash and Zsh completions are available. There is also a
\fI\%Oh\-my\-zsh\fP plugin available

Tizonia includes a fairly comprehensive help system with information about
general usage, included streaming services, configuration elements, and
command\-line options supported.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.sp
Tizonia ships with a configuration file template. See below for the system
locations where this template is usually installed. On first use, Tizonia
copies this file into the user\(aqs local configuration directory, usually in one
of these locations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf\fP (Debian and AUR installations)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$HOME/snap/tizonia/current/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf\fP (Snap installation)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Customization of this file by the user is typically required, e.g. to add
credentials for the subscribed streaming services. Note that Tizonia only reads
this file, never writes to it.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When user names and passwords are stored in your local
\fBtizonia.conf\fP, please ensure that this file has the correct
file system permissions to prevent other users from accessing your
credentials.
.sp
E.g.: \fB$ chmod og\-rwx $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf\fP

Configuration file: \(aqtizonia.conf\(aq

Tizonia creates its config file in one of the following locations when it
first starts (add your user credentials here):
    \- Debian or AUR packages: $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf
    \- Snap package: $HOME/snap/tizonia/current/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf

When Tizonia is upgraded, a new version of the \fBtizonia.conf\fP
template is installed in the corresponding system location. An
exising configuration file located under the user\(aqs local
configuration directory will remain unmodified. In order to access
the new features, the user is expected to manually update his/her
local configuration file. This is optional however, as an old
configuration file will remain functional and backguard\-compatible
when used by a newer version of the software. Please note the version
information at the top of \fBtizonia.conf\fP\&.

[color\-themes]
# Tizonia uses around 16 different colors while displaying information on the
# terminal. These colors are referred to in this configuration file as:
# C01, C02, ..., C15, C16.
#
# There are three options for specifying the color codes (depending on the
# number of colors supported by the terminal; most terminals should support all
# three options).
#
# OPTION 1: 3/4\-bit color codes
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit
#           Normal FG colors: 30\-37 \- Bright FG colors: 90\-97
#           Normal BG colors: 40\-47 \- Bright BG colors: 100\-107
#
# OPTION 2: 8\-bit color codes:
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8\-bit
#           38,5,⟨n⟩ \-> Foreground color
#           48,5,⟨n⟩ \-> Background color
#
# OPTION 3: 24\-bit color codes:
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#24\-bit
#           38,2,⟨r⟩,⟨g⟩,⟨b⟩ \-> RGB foreground color
#           48,2,⟨r⟩,⟨g⟩,⟨b⟩ \-> RGB background color
#
# In addition to the foreground and background color codes, the font display
# attributes or \(aqdecorations\(aq may also be specified.
#
# Display attributes (a.k.a. decorations):
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_parameters
#           1 \-> Bold, 2 \-> Faint, 3 \-> Italic, 4 \-> Underline, 5 \-> Slow blink,
#           etc...
#
# Then, to specify a C01\-C16 color for Tizonia, choose one of the bit depth
# options above and compose your Cxy code like this:
#
# Cxy = <fg>,<bg>,<attr>
#
# Note that there is no need to provide all three of <fg>, <bg> and <attr>, but
# at least one of them should be given for the Cxy color to be of any use.
#
# You can use multiple bit\-depth definitions in a color theme (e.g. C01\-C08
# defined using 3/4 bit codes, and C09\-C16 using 24\-bit), but you should stick
# with one bit\-depth for <fg>,<bg> within the same Cxy definition.
#
#
#
# There are four color themes available in this config file:
#
#  tizonia (the default theme), black, blink, and monokai
#
# To activate a color theme, add its name and uncomment the following line.
#
# active\-theme = tizonia

Note that Tizonia caches the authentication token received from Google Play
Music on the first successful access to the service (i.e. with a valid

attempts to access the service. When the token expires, Tizonia accesses the

on the Internet that may help with finding the device id on Android or iOS
devices. There are also some apps in the Google Play store that may help with
that, e.g.  \fI\%Device ID\fP\&.
If you are a Google Play Music subscriber, you may also try to input a random
device id. When using a random device id with a subscriber account, the
software will return a list of real device ids associated to the account.
.TP

#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit
#           Normal FG colors: 30\-37 \- Bright FG colors: 90\-97
#           Normal BG colors: 40\-47 \- Bright BG colors: 100\-107
#
# OPTION 2: 8\-bit color codes:
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8\-bit
#           38,5,⟨n⟩ \-> Foreground color
#           48,5,⟨n⟩ \-> Background color
#
# OPTION 3: 24\-bit color codes:
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#24\-bit
#           38,2,⟨r⟩,⟨g⟩,⟨b⟩ \-> RGB foreground color
#           48,2,⟨r⟩,⟨g⟩,⟨b⟩ \-> RGB background color
#
# In addition to the foreground and background color codes, the font display
# attributes or \(aqdecorations\(aq may also be specified.
#
# Display attributes (a.k.a. decorations):
#     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_parameters
#           1 \-> Bold, 2 \-> Faint, 3 \-> Italic, 4 \-> Underline, 5 \-> Slow blink,
#           etc...
#
# Then, to specify a C01\-C16 color for Tizonia, choose one of the bit depth
# options above and compose your Cxy code like this:
#
# Cxy = <fg>,<bg>,<attr>
#
# Note that there is no need to provide all three of <fg>, <bg> and <attr>, but
# at least one of them should be given for the Cxy color to be of any use.
#
# You can use multiple bit\-depth definitions in a color theme (e.g. C01\-C08
# defined using 3/4 bit codes, and C09\-C16 using 24\-bit), but you should stick
# with one bit\-depth for <fg>,<bg> within the same Cxy definition.
#
#
#
# There are four color themes available in this config file:
#
#  tizonia (the default theme), black, blink, and monokai
#
# To activate a color theme, add its name and uncomment the following line.

.SS Tizonia on a headless Raspberry Pi
.sp
It is posible to run Tizonia on a headless Raspberry Pi (e.g. a Raspberry Pi
Zero with Raspbian Lite).
.sp
Tizonia has a dependency against D\-Bus but normally, the D\-Bus daemon is not
even started without X11. In this case, it is necessary to make sure that the
D\-Bus daemon has been started prior to using Tizonia.
.sp
See this \fI\%recipe\fP for an idea on how to launch
the D\-Bus daemon on your headless Raspberry Pi.
