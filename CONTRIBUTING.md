## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as
possible. Have a look at the [issue template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for ideas.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing
> that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original
> issue in the body of your new one.


### Suggesting New Features

You are welcome to submit ideas for new features and enhancements, just include
as many details as possible, including potential implementation options.


### First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through the `good-first-issue`
or `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues][good-first-issues] - issues which should only require a few lines of code.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good-first-issue` issues.

#### Local Development

Have a look at the [project's components](PROJECT.md), and follow the
instructions on how to [build Tizonia from source](BUILDING.md). And of course,
don't hesitate to ask.

#### Documentation

- See [docs.tizonia.org](http://docs.tizonia.org/) for the project's official documentation.

- The [Wiki](https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/wiki) may also
contain some useful information (although in need of an update).
